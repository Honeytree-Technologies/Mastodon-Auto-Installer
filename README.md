## Script Details

- **Language**: Bash
- **Deployment**: Docker-based Mastodon installation.
- **Configuration Options**:
  - Elasticsearch deployment (off by default).
  - Adjustable Postgres DB size (default: 256MB).
  - Automatic SSL certificate creation using Let's Encrypt along with Nginx configuration.

## Requirements

- Server or VPS with minimum 4GB RAM, 2 vCPU, and 65 GB storage.
- Ubuntu v22.04 LTS.
- Open ports: 22922 (SSH), 443, and 80.
- Active internet connection to fetch packages and Docker images.
- Domain name pointing to the server's IP address (necessary for SSL certification).
- An email delivery service or SMTP server.

## Installation Steps

1. Log into your server as the root user.
2. Execute the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    curl -sSL http://code.honeytreetech.com/fediverse/mastodon/auto-installer/auto_script.sh -o ./auto_script.sh && sudo chmod +x auto_script.sh && ./auto_script.sh
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter details like username, email, domain name, SMTP server information, DB size, Elasticsearch preference, etc.

## After Installation

- Visit your Mastodon instance using the provided domain.
- Default SSH port: 22922.
- Fail2Ban is active and set to block progressively.

## Security Recommendations

For optimal security post-installation, consider:

- **Regular Updates**: Keep system packages and applications up-to-date.
- **Firewall Tuning**: Restrict traffic to only necessary ports.
- **User Management**: Minimize or disable root access. Use sudo for admin tasks.
- **Password Policies**: Adopt strong passwords. Consider password manager usage.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enable 2FA for vital services/accounts.
- **Backups**: Create regular backups and store them securely.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Monitor for unusual activities and set up alerts.
- **Application Security**: Research and apply Mastodon-specific security practices.
- **Periodic Review**: Regularly assess your security measures.

Staying informed and proactive is key in the digital security landscape.

## Troubleshooting

### Known Issues

1. **Error**: "Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend..."
   - **Cause**: `unattended-upgr` process.
   - **Fix**:

     ```bash
     sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend
     ```
     Then, restart the script and pick an SSL certificate option:
     a. Try reinstalling the current certificate.
     b. Renew & replace the certificate.
