- fail2ban is activated with progressive blocking.

## Post-Installation Security Recommendations

Once you have successfully deployed Mastodon using this script, it's crucial to take additional steps to secure and harden your environment. 

Consider the following actions:

- **Regular Updates**: Ensure that all system packages and software are regularly updated to patch potential vulnerabilities.
- **Firewall Configuration**: Fine-tune your firewall settings to allow only necessary traffic and block potential threats.
- **User Access**: Limit or disable root access. Use sudo for administrative tasks and avoid using the root account for daily tasks.
- **Secure Passwords**: Implement strong password policies, and consider using password managers.
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Where possible, enable 2FA for critical services and accounts.
- **Backup**: Regularly back up critical data and ensure backups are stored securely.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Set up monitoring and logging to detect and alert on suspicious activities.
- **Application-Specific Security**: Explore and implement security best practices specifically tailored to Mastodon and any other applications you might be running.
- **Review and Audit**: Periodically review and audit your security settings and practices to ensure they are up-to-date with the latest threats and vulnerabilities.

It's essential to recognize that the security landscape is dynamic. Stay informed, and be proactive in securing your digital assets.

## Troubleshooting
### Known Issues

1. **Error**: "Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend..."
   - **Cause**: `unattended-upgr` process.
   - **Fix**:

     ```bash
     sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend
     ```
     Then, restart the script and pick an SSL certificate option:
     a. Try reinstalling the current certificate.
     b. Renew & replace the certificate.
